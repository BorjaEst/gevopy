"""The :mod:`algorithms` module is intended to contain some specific
algorithms in order to execute the most common evolutionary algorithms.

The methods used here are more for convenience than reference as the
implementation of every evolutionary algorithm may vary infinitely. Most
of the algorithms in this module use operators registered in the tools
package.

    This components can be assigned to an algorithm class by Inheritance

    can be created and edited after, but their values are limited to the

    When an algoritm has the property crossover, you can usually configure
    a second `selection` argument `selection2` to control how the algorithm
    selects the secondary phenotype.
