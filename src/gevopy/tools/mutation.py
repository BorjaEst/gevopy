    from one generation of a population of genetic algorithm chromosomes
    to the next. It is analogous to biological mutation.

    A mutation operator involves a probability that an arbitrary bit in
    a genetic chain will be flipped from its original state.

    Mutation operators are used in an attempt to avoid local minima by
    preventing the population of chromosomes from becoming too similar
    to each other, thus slowing or even stopping convergence to the global
    optimum. This reasoning also leads most GA systems to avoid only taking
    the fittest of the population in generating the next generation, but
    rather selecting a random (or semi-random) set with a weighting toward
    those that are fitter.

    For different genome types, different mutation types are suitable.
