    "This example, shows how to use gevopy to evolve a simple Haploid genotype in order to obtain a genotype with at least 10 ones in it's chromosome. In the process, all the genotypes are stored inside a neo4j database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, it is required to import gevopy and generate the Genotype, Fitness and Algorithm required. For the aim of simplicity, we will use some already defined examples from this library. Additionally it is required to import the class Neo4jInterface to specify the connection with our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can use neo4j library to verify the connection and the logging module to increase the verbosity of the evolution process."
