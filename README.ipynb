    "## Usage\n",
    "This package is designed in order to create your own evolution scripts based on the following concepts:\n",
    " - **Chromosomes**: Genetic instructions for phenotypes.\n",
    " - **Genotype**: Genetic design to instantiate phenotypes.\n",
    " - **Phenotypes**: Genotype instances which perform a task.\n",
    " - **Fitness**: Provide the methods to evaluate genotypes.\n",
    " - **Algorithm**: Evolution procedure for phenotypes.\n",
    " - **Experiment**: Evolution session with genotypes.\n",
    "\n",

    "Graph traversal operations such 'genealogy tree' or certain matches can\n",
    "be performed with no index lookups leading to much better performance.\n",

    "### Why pydantic instead of dataclass?\n",
    "Pydantic supports validation of fields during and after the\n",
    "initialization process and makes parsing easier. \n",
    "Parsing is a relevant step if you are planing to save your\n",
    "genotypes into the connected database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "Collections containing collections can not be stored in properties.\n",
    "Property values can only be of primitive types or arrays in Neo4J Cypher queries."
